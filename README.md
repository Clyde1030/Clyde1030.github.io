### About Me
Hi, I'm YuSheng, and welcome to my data science journey.

I began my professional path as an actuarial student, passing three actuarial exams while working at an insurance company in Portland, Oregon. During this time, I became increasingly interested in the tools and technologies that powered our financial reporting processes. While my initial focus was on actuarial modeling, I found myself fascinated by the behind-the-scenes systems that made everything run — from Python scripts and SQL queries to VBA macros automating Excel reports.

On the reinsurance team, I had the chance to work closely with modularized Python code and shell scripts, which served as bridges between various platforms and languages. Our reporting was deeply integrated with Microsoft SQL Server, and Excel was our primary output format. Through this experience, I developed strong skills in Python (especially with Object-Oriented Programming), SQL, and VBA — all of which were essential in automating and optimizing our workflows.

But what really captured my interest was the broader world of data engineering. I discovered a deep sense of satisfaction in building data pipelines from scratch — turning raw data into structured, actionable insights. Over time, this curiosity evolved into a clear career direction.

Today, I’m pursuing data engineering full-time, building on my foundation in analytics and programming. I enjoy designing scalable systems, optimizing data flow, and working with both traditional and modern data stack tools. Whether it's constructing ETL pipelines, managing databases, or diving into big data technologies, I’m passionate about making data move — efficiently and meaningfully.

This website is a reflection of that journey: the things I’ve learned, the challenges I’ve tackled, and the projects I’ve built along the way. Thanks for visiting!
